                        IEEE DTU Student Branch , under the aegis of IEEE Global, is the oldest student branch
                        in Delhi Section with an illustrious history of over three decades.
                        <br><br>
                        Under the invaluable guidance of Dr. J. Panda, IEEE DTU has emerged as one of the most
                        active and innovative student branches in India. IEEE DTU organizes a plethora of events
                        around the year such as TECHWEEK, MICROHACK and the annual technical festival TROIKA to
                        instil a scientific temperament in students and to cater to the needs of their
                        inquisitive nature. IEEE DTU is also renowned for its publications- ECHO, a magazine for
                        freshers, IOTA, the annual technical magazine, TRIGGER, the TROIKA souvenir, and The
                        Troika Times. In the year 2012, one of the commendable feats of IEEE DTU Student Branch
                        was the organizing of ISSET (International Symposium on Standards in Engineering &
                        Technology), which provided a platform for student researchers, besides academic and
                        professional experts, to share and exchange their ideas.
                        <br><br>
                        IEEE DTU student members get a chance to be in touch with the latest technical
                        information, research and career opportunities. Not only do they take part in several
                        events, but also get a chance to organize them with their young and capable hands. “Toil
                        to attain thy heights”. By following this mantra with heart in work and mind in place,
                        and feet firmly on ground, IEEE DTU is poised for a quantum leap forward.
